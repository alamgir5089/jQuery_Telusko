<!-- Autocomplete widget(if you use this you will get some suggetions like google search) Enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.
When typing in the autocomplete field, the plugin starts searching for entries that match and displays a list of values to choose from. By entering more characters, the user can filter down the list to better matches.
